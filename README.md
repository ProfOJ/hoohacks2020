# Zoom Education Suite (ZEST)
A woldwide pandemic has pushed education out of the classroom and onto online forums for much of the world. Zoom has emerged as one of the services leading the way in the transition to internet lessons. While certainly a capable platform in its current state, zoom posesses some inherent limitations as a clasroom substitute. We believed optimizations could be made to improve accessiblility for differently abled students as well as to provide feedback to the instructor to more actively engage with their classes.

## Some of these innovations include:

* To create a more accessible online classroom, we worked to develop a closed captioning service. This allows students with limited hearing to follow along more closely and improves usability for all.

* To improve the professors' grasp of their students comprehension of the material, we added a number of ways to collect more data about classroom engagement. (i.e. Total number of hands raised, class attendance, facial expressions)
